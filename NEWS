NEWS for gWidgetsWWW

Changes for  0.0-8
--------------------

* Major changes to implement RApache as the backend, in place of
  RPad. The Rpad project seems to be abandoned, despite its very
  interesting core. However, using RApache greatly diminishes the
  security issues that RPad raises and *hopefully* will make
  gWidgetsWWW much more stable

 The configuration of RApache is very important. Sample template in
 templates directory

* requires filehash and digest packages to manage
  sesssions. Sesssion are used to store state between requests

* AJAX features are implemented through a script gWidgetsWWWAJAX.R

* Added gcanvas widget for using the canvas device package of Jeffrey
  Horner. This is replacing the gprocessingjs package, which isn't
  working as of now.

* added gsvg widget which is similar to gcanvas widget. Can be used
  with SVG devices (RSVGTipsDevice, or SVGAnnotation). 

* added gspinbutton widget, although trigger icons not showing.
