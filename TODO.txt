## TODO version 0.1+
* SAFARI broken? why (svalue(button)<-)
* gdf fixes
* forgot to do a popup: addpopupmenu, add3rdmouse ...

  from a data vector? Really want to load from a handler
* drag and drop functions

function addCommas(nStr)
{
	nStr += '';
	x = nStr.split('.');
	x1 = x[0];
	x2 = x.length > 1 ? '.' + x[1] : '';
	var rgx = /(\d+)(\d{3})/;
	while (rgx.test(x1)) {
		x1 = x1.replace(rgx, '$1' + ',' + '$2');
	}
	return x1 + x2;
}
* subwindow needs an on-demand scrollbar HOW
* FOr gcomobox we should allow items to be a) a vector b) a data frame
  [DONE} c)a EXTStore object (so that we only print these once) d) a
  URL with some information about how to read it into JSON object
* createDelegate to pass info to handlers (kye=value) --implement,
  current one is not very good. Needed for ginput, gconfirm? one

  * made optional for now.
