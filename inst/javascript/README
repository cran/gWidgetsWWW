These files are needed to use the gprocessingjs widget. This widget
allows the canvas widget to be used to draw on through some of R's
base graphical commands.

To install:

a) place the files so that your webserver can see them. If you use the
local version of Rpad this can be the directory you start the script
from. If the serverversion, you can use the root directory.

b) call in the javascript files in the header of your html document:

<!-- Call in processing -->
<script type="text/javascript" src="processing.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript" src="processinginit.js"></script>

See ex-gprocessingjs for examples
